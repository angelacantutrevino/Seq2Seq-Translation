# Seq2Seq-Translation

Throughout this project, in order to provide advice to a business looking to translate their natural language questions into structured query language (SQL), we propose to develop a recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder-decoder model. Therefore, we begin by reading and analysing our dataset which we obtained from Spider: A large-scale human-labelled dataset for complex and cross-domain semantic parsing and text-to-SQL task, which can be accesed here (https://yale-lily.github.io/spider).
